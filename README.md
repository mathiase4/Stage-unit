## Lighthouse Diagnostics Desktop and Mobile
- Large contentful paint element.
- preconnect to required origins.
- eliminate render-blocking resources.
- image elements need to have width description and height to make lighthouse read it easier.
- had some yellow diagnostics from javascript but im not using javascript.
- for the most part was the problem the images and the sizes of them.

  

## Site owner's goal
To spread more interest in playing guitar and instruments overall. The goal is to guide people toward learning productive skills through music.

  ## manual Testing
  - used html validator for index.html,merch.html,book-guitar-lesson.html and guitar-shop.html and everything is green now.
  - used css validator and everything in my css code is green now.
  - used lighthouse testing, got 98% in Desktop Performance, and 74 Performance in Mobile, 96 in Best Practices. most of the red ones was because of high photo px and alot of too good quality images.
  - Tested the website on different screen sizes (mobile,desktop and xxl screens) to check responsiveness.
  - Clicked through all navigation links and buttons to make sure they work correctly.
  - i have learned that i need to check the px and the quality of the images i use before i use them. to make the preformance of the site the best.
